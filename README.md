# Virtual-friend-using-python

I have used many libraries here, but 'pyttsx3' and 'SpeechRecognition' are most important libraries in this project. They are used for Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text conversion operations.
It has the ability to scrap the details from web, recognize the persons by their faces, detecting the object, managing bluetooth and wi-fi devices, handling media files and messages. 
It can do some operation automatically while starting.

  - import pyttsx3
  - import speech_recognition as sr

  - import sys
  - import os
  - import cv2
